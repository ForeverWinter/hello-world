# hello-world
first GitHub repo

Hi ya'll.  I'm going through the GitHub hello-world activity to get a sense of what it might be like for someone who is unfamiliar with Git.

## Feature Numero Dos
This here be a feature.  The second feature in fact.  The interesting thing about this one is that I'm trying out Atom and GitKraken to manage my edits

## One last edit (I hope)
And one ore edit - the third one.
